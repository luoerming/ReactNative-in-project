## Step1:
If you dont'have cocoaPods installed, execute the following command in Terminal;

`gem install cocoapods`

Next, install nodeJs

`brew install node`

Finally, use the following command to instruct Homebrew to install watchman;

`brew install watchman`

You now have the basic React-Native scaffolding in palce, Now you can install the modules you project will use.

## Step2:
Create a file named Podfile. Add the following to the file:

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
target 'ReactNative-in-project' do
    use_frameworks!
    pod 'React', :path => './react-component/node_modules/react-native', :subspecs => [
        'Core',
        'RCTImage',
        'RCTNetwork',
        'RCTText',
        'RCTWebSocket',

    target 'ReactNative-in-projectTests' do
        inherit! :search_paths
    end

    target 'ReactNative-in-projectUITests' do
        inherit! :search_paths
    end
end
```
Then, Run the following command to install the dependencies:

`pod install`

## Step3:
Create a folder named react-component in the project root directory. And Create a file named package.json in the react-component folder root directory. Add the following to the file;

```ruby
{
  "name": "ReactNative-in-project",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "15.3.2",
    "react-native": "0.35.0"
  },
  "jest": {
    "preset": "jest-react-native"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-jest": "16.0.0",
    "babel-preset-react-native": "1.9.0",
    "jest": "16.0.1",
    "jest-react-native": "16.0.0",
    "react-test-renderer": "15.3.2"
  }
}
```

Next, Run the command to install the required Node.js modules;

## Step4
Go to react-component folder. And run the following command to starting NodeJs servers;

`npm start`

## Step5

For security reasons, Apple by default blocks HTTP access to URLs. Youâ€™ll have to make an exception so you can load your bundle from the development server running on http://localhost.
In Xcode, open Info.plist and perform the following:

```ruby
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
    <dict>
        <key>localhost</key>
        <dict>
            <key>NSTemporaryExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
            <true/>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</dict>
```
